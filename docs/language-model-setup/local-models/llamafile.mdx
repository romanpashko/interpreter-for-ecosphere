To use LlamaFile with Open Interpreter, you'll need to download the model and start the server by running the file in the terminal. You can do this with the following commands:

```bash
# Download Mixtral

wget https://huggingface.co/jartine/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1.llamafile/resolve/main/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1.Q5_K_M-server.llamafile

# Make it an executable

chmod +x mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1.Q5_K_M-server.llamafile

# Start the server

./mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1.Q5_K_M-server.llamafile

# In a separate terminal window, run OI and point it at the llamafile server

interpreter --api_base https://localhost:8080
```

Please note that if you are using a Mac with Apple Silicon, you'll need to have Xcode installed.
