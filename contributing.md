# Contributing to Open Interpreter 

Thank you for your interest in contributing! As an open source project, we rely on developers like you to make conversational AI accessible.

There are many ways to contribute, from reporting bugs and suggesting features to improving the code. We appreciate you taking the time to get involved.

## Roadmap

We are working on developing a public roadmap to provide visibility into our priorities and upcoming enhancements.

For now, our focus is on resolving issues with CodeLlama integration and keeping the core interpreter logic simple and understandable. We want to empower non-coders by turning natural language into executable actions.

As such, we aim to keep the codebase simplified rather than overly complex. Our goal is to give the power of coding - turning words into actions - to people without coding knowledge. We welcome discussions on how to maintain this approach as we add new capabilities.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug or have a brilliant feature in mind, don't hesitate to [open a new issue](https://github.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter/issues/new). To ensure a swift and effective response, please provide the following:

- **Bug Reports:** Include detailed steps to reproduce the issue, along with specifics about your operating system and Python version, with screenshots and code/error snippets if required.
- **Feature Requests:** Provide a comprehensive explanation of how your idea benefits Open Interpreter and its community.

## Contributing Code

We welcome code contributions through pull requests. Here are some guidelines:

- Before taking on significant code changes, please discuss your ideas on [Discord](https://discord.gg/qUxNuW4B) to ensure they align with our project vision. We want to keep the codebase simple and unintimidating for new users.

- Fork the repository and create a new branch for your work.

- Make changes with clear code comments explaining your approach. Try to follow existing conventions in the code.

- Open a PR to `main` linking any related issues. Provide detailed context on your changes.

- We will review PRs when possible and work with you to integrate your contribution. Please be patient as reviews take time. 

- Once approved, your code will be merged - thank you for improving Open Interpreter!
